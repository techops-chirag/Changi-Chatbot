    "content": "Security And Baggage Restrictions Security Screening and Baggage Restrictions Important information and tips for clearing security. Baggage Restrictions Liquids, Aerosols, Gels BAGGAGE RESTRICTIONS As part of international safety measures to protect you and your loved ones when travelling, some items may be prohibited on the aircraft. It is an offence if you fail to comply with these measures, as the safety of all passengers on the flight could be compromised. Generally, you must not take on board items listed below. Do note that these lists are not exhaustive. Firearms of any kind, including replicas and toys. More Pointed/edged weapons or sharp objects (e.g., multi-purpose tool kits of all sizes). More Blunt objects (e.g., bats, skateboards and paddles). More Chemical and toxic substances, as well as dangerous goods. More Corrosive substances (e.g., batteries, mercury or drain cleaners) Hand-carried luggage guidelines Hydrocarbon gas-powered hair curlers are limited to one per person. The safety cover must be securely fitted at all times over the heating element. Separate gas refills for such curlers are not permitted. Safety matches or lighters are permitted only when carried on the person. The lighter can contain only absorbed liquid or liquefied gas fuel. Refills are not permitted. Battery-powered wheelchairs are permissible as checked luggage only. However, do contact your airline in advance to check whether special conditions apply. Restrictions apply to Liquids, Aerosols and Gels (LAGs) in hand-carried luggage. Specific to passengers travelling to EU airports (including Switzerland), only LAGs in sealed Security Tamper Evident Bags (STEB) bearing the SGP state code, purchased within the transit areas of Singapore Changi Airport will be allowed onboard due to security restrictions imposed by EU. If in doubt, please check with your airline before your flight. Powder-like substances kept in a single container and which are heavier than 350g (or 350ml) are prohibited by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in hand-carried bags on all U.S.-based airlines as well as on non-stop flights to the U.S.A. If you need to carry larger amounts of powdered substances, they must be in checked baggage. Exceptions to this include: Duty-free purchases packed in Security Tamper Evident Bags (STEB). Restrictions may apply. Please check with your respective airline. Human remains. Baby formula, if you are travelling with an infant. Medication, accompanied by a doctor's letter. All powder-like substances in carry-on bags may be subjected to further screening. Please check with your airline for advice before your flight. LIQUIDS, AEROSOLS AND GELS Singapore implemented guidelines that restrict the amount of liquids, aerosols and gels (LAGs) that passengers can carry in their hand-carried luggage. LAGs that do not meet the guidelines must be checked-in. Guidelines on LAGs These apply to all flights departing from Singapore. LAGs in containers exceeding 100ml will not be accepted, even if partially filled. Grams and millilitres can be used interchangeably. Place the containers (not exceeding 1 litre in total) in a transparent, re-sealable plastic bag which must be completely closed. Only one transparent, re-sealable plastic bag per passenger is allowed. The bag must be presented separately for examination at the security screening point. All LAGs that do not meet the above requirements must be disposed of before the security screening point. Exemptions can be made for baby food & breast milk, provided your infant is travelling with you. Other items may also be exempted upon presentation of a bona fide doctor\u2019s letter. Additional checks may be conducted for the safety of all passengers. LAGs purchased at Changi which are in containers larger than 100ml should be kept sealed in their sealed tamper-evident bags provided by the shops, with the receipt clearly displayed in the sealed bags. Examples of LAGs Drinks (e.g., water or juices) Soups and sauces Perfumes and deodorants (liquid or liquid-solid mixture) Creams, balms, lotions and oils Cosmetics (e.g., mascara or lip gloss) Pastes (e.g., toothpaste) Pressurised foams and sprays (e.g., shaving foam, hairspray or spray deodorants) Gels (e.g., hair or shower gels) Contact lens solution Canned food with liquid content Any other items of similar consistency Purchasing LAGs at Changi Shopping within Public Area If you have purchased LAGs from shops within Changi Airport's Public Areas, please place the items into your check-in luggage prior to checking-in for your flight. If the items do not exceed a maximum capacity of 100ml per container, you may hand-carry them in the 1-litre transparent and re-sealable plastic bag, which must be completely closed. Shopping within Departure Transit Area You can continue to purchase LAGs, such as liquor, wine, beer, perfumes and cosmetics, at shops located within Changi Airport's Departure Transit Area.
